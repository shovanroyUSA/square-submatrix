# square-submatrix
Write a program to, given a square matrix with elements of 0 or 1, find the first square submatrix with all 1 elements. This square submatrix should be as big as it can be, but it must include only ones and be at least 3
in size. Your program should prompt the user to enter the number of rows in the matrix. The number of rows
should be at least 5. The program then displays the location of the first element in the square submatrix and
the number of the rows in the submatrix.
